# Myskin-backend
For my website's backend I started off by running "npm init -y" to create a package.json and then creating the following files: .gitignore and index.js

I then added “start”: “node src/index.js” to create a npm script on the json file.

I then ran console.log('hello world');
and created a string for first name and last name as follows:

* let firstname = "samiha"

* let lastname = "sher"

* let finalString = firstname + "," + " " + lastname

* console.log('finalString:', finalString);

* console.log('\n===\n');

I then ran "npm start" to test it

## Phase 2

* created a new branch "phase 2"
* developed two modules: user.js (adding sample users into the web app) and routines.js (building the skincare routines of sample users)
* assigned for a peer review

## Phase 3
* Reviewed peer feedback, implemented and updated code accordingly
* Installed and updated json with Jest
* Added routines.test.js to test the functions in routines.js using NPM test to ensure that they are exeucting accurately on the number of steps in a given skincare routine
* Setup a continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub to automatically check
